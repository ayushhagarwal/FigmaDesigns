## Figma UX Designs
* This project repository is a collection of different UX Designs of some random websites. 
* The projects have their respective Figma design files and a sample image or a video showing the designs.
* Each project also has pictures of the deisgn frames exported directly from the design

### Contribution and License
Any developer is free to take these designs and create a website of these templates or modify them, it would be nice to give credits for the designs.( Some of the designs in the repo are YT tutorials which I did for practice, so no credits required for those).
